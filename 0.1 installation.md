see this articule.

4. (change the date version)
```
$ bash ~/Downloads/Anaconda3-2019.10-MacOSX-x86_64.sh
```
5. press enter when it's asking you path.

6. another yes of “Do you wish the installer to initialize Anaconda3 by running conda init?”
but I didn't press yes, it processed automatically.

7.
If you'd prefer that conda's base environment not be activated on startup, 
   
   set the auto_activate_base parameter to false: 
```
conda config --set auto_activate_base false
```
Thank you for installing Anaconda3!

8. check if this command works.
```
$ conda list
```

## after installation

### why there is a base in my terminal?

because auto_activate_base is set to True. 
You can check this using the following command
```
$ conda config --show | grep auto_activate_base
```
=> auto_activate_base: True

To set it false
```
$ conda config --set auto_activate_base False
```

## basic commands

```
$ conda create -n firstTest anaconda
```

2. To activate this environment, use
```
