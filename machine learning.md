## Overview
- iteratively learn from data
- give the machine a set of rules to follow instead of what to looking for
- machine find it on its own
- three types:
  - supervised
    - labeled data
      > continuous data > regression problem
    
      > categorical data > classification problem
    - feature, label, task
    - process:
      - data acquire
      - data cleaning (time consuming)
      - split to:
        > training set
        > testing set 30%
      - train model
      - evaluate model
      - adjust parameter
  - unsupervised
    - No label
    - task: cluster
    - interpret: up to the scientist > domain knowledge   
    - only traning set
  - reinforcement
    - trial and error to yield the greatest reward
 - hold out set, the thrid set
   to get the idea how well your model runs, a final report
